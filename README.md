# Chrono-sequence
Analysis of total carbon, recalcitrant pyrogenic carbon, nitrogen and carbon to nitrogen ratio in 
relation to fire type and time since fire. GAMs were used to allow for non-linear responses, with sites 
treated as random effects. All working R code is in Rmarkdown documents, with the code for the main analyses
in the file gams.Rmd.
